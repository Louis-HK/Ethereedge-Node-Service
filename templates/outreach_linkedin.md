Hi {{firstName}},

I help traders and developers deploy **private Ethereum RPC endpoints** optimized for MEV bots and arbitrage strategies.  

Compared to public RPCs (Infura, QuickNode, Alchemy), you get:  
- A **dedicated node** for consistent low latency  
- Provisioning in **<24 hours**  
- **Secure API key** + monitoring  
- Custom **performance benchmarks**  
- Direct support with SLA  

I can send you a quick demo endpoint along with a latency comparison so you can test the difference.  

Would you like me to share one?
