Subject: Private Ethereum Endpoint for MEV / Arbitrage – Quick Demo

Hi {{firstName}},

I provide private Ethereum endpoints optimized for MEV bots and arbitrage strategies.  
Unlike public services (Infura, QuickNode, Alchemy), you get:

- A **dedicated node** – no noisy neighbors, predictable latency.  
- Provisioning in **under 24 hours**.  
- **Secure API key** + monitoring.  
- **Custom performance benchmarks** for your use case.  
- Direct support (Slack/Telegram) with **SLA guarantees**.

I can share a latency + stability comparison in 10 minutes.  
Would you like me to send you a test endpoint?

Best regards,  
Louis
