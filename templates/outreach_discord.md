Hey {{username}},  
I run **private Ethereum RPC nodes** that are fine-tuned for **MEV bots & arbitrage**.  
If you’re tired of unstable latency on public endpoints, this might help:

✅ Dedicated node (no noisy neighbors)  
⚡ <24h provisioning  
🔑 API key access + monitoring  
📊 Custom latency benchmarks  
🤝 Direct support via Telegram/Discord

I can set up a test endpoint for you to try — wanna check the speed difference?
