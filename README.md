## 🚀 Overview
EtherEdge RPC is a **high-performance, private Ethereum node service** designed for traders, quant developers, and arbitrageurs who require predictable latency, zero noisy neighbors, and fully controlled access.  
By combining **dedicated infrastructure** with lightweight provisioning automation, EtherEdge ensures faster transaction propagation and consistent MEV execution advantages.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Deliver **private, low-latency** Ethereum endpoints for MEV and arbitrage strategies.
- Ensure **isolation** from public RPC traffic to prevent unpredictable delays.
- Provide **API key-based access control** with flexible rotation.
- Offer **real-time latency benchmarks** for transparency.
- Enable **rapid onboarding** (<30 minutes) for traders and devs.

---

## 🧩 Core Components
- **Provisioning Layer** – Automated scripts for Geth / Erigon node setup with RPC/WebSocket enabled.
- **Access Control** – API key enforcement via Nginx reverse proxy or custom middleware.
- **Monitoring & Health Checks** – Automatic restarts, latency logging, uptime metrics.
- **Latency Benchmarking** – Built-in tools to compare EtherEdge against public RPCs.
- **Client Integration Examples** – Ready-to-use curl, Web3.py, and ethers.js scripts.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Geth / Erigon** (Ethereum node software)
- **Nginx** (reverse proxy + API key enforcement)
- **Bash** (provisioning scripts)
- **Python** (latency tests, monitoring scripts)
- **Docker** (optional containerized deployment)
- **Hetzner / OVH** (dedicated hosting)
- **GitHub Actions** (CI for benchmarking scripts)

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Linux VPS / dedicated server (Ubuntu 22.04 recommended)
- Public IP & domain (for API endpoint)
- Basic Linux CLI skills
- API key (generated at setup)
- Optional: TLS certificate (via Let’s Encrypt)

---

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourAccount/ethereedge-node-service.git
cd provisioning
chmod +x install_geth.sh setup_rpc.sh

# Install Geth and start syncing
./install_geth.sh

# Configure API key and endpoint domain
./setup_rpc.sh --key your_api_key --domain example.com
